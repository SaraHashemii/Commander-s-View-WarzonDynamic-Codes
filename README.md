## Game Overview

### Title: Commander's View: Warzone Dynamics

Modern-era war game that represents a novel fusion of real-time strategy (RTS) and third-person shooter gameplay. Designed to appeal to audiences who enjoy both strategic depth and direct combat engagement, this game features a dual-phase mechanic where players can switch between a strategic RTS view to manage units while switching to the third-person perspective, demonstrating how the scenario could look from the perspective of a soldier. The game aims for a degree of realism, thus most of the projectiles leverage the Unity Physics Engine. The reason behind using the Unity physics system instead of raycasting is to be more like some of the games in the industry that are fun because they look real, such as War Thunder or World of Tanks. In these games, all projectiles are based on real physics, which gives them a uniqueness that attracts many players.
